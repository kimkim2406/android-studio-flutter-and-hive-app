# Notes Application

This is a mobile application developed using Flutter and Hive for local storage. It allows users to create, edit, and delete notes efficiently and store them locally on their devices.

## Features

- **Create Notes**: Users can add new notes with a title and content.
- **Edit Notes**: Existing notes can be edited and updated at any time.
- **Delete Notes**: Users can delete notes they no longer need.
- **Local Storage**: All notes are stored locally using Hive, a lightweight and fast NoSQL database.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: A UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Hive**: A lightweight and blazing-fast key-value database written in pure Dart.
